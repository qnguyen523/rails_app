# Project Title
* Task Management Application

# About The Project
* This project features a task management tool that allows users to manage and prioritize their tasks.
* Users can build their own to-do list. Each task can be set to a deadline and a priority so that they can always stay on track of their schedule.
* Users can view a list of incomplete tasks and comprehensive list of all tasks.
* By checking a checkbox, an associated task that is considered completed would be no longer displayed in the list of incomplete tasks.
* However, the completed tasks can still be accessible on the comprehensive list where users can delete tasks permanently.
